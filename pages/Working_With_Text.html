        <h3>Working with Text</h3>
        <p>Everything you see in this section is content as discussed previously all content goes in our &lt;body&gt*Content goes here&lt;/body&gt;</p>
        <h3>How to make headers</h3>
            <p>There are 6 diffent levels of headers in html, h1-h6 the following is how big they are and what their tags look like:</p>
            <h1>&lt;h1&gt;</h1>
            <h2>&lt;h2&gt;</h2>
            <h3>&lt;h3&gt;</h3>
            <h4>&lt;h4&gt;</h4>
            <h5>&lt;h5&gt;</h5>
            <h6>&lt;h6&gt;</h6>
        <h3>Paragraphs and fancy texts</h3>
        <p>Paragraphs are nice and easy, &lt;p&gt;*content*&lt;/p&gt; will make you a paragraph, you can use other tags within paragraphs as Well
            like strong or em tags, &lt;strong&gt;<strong>strong</strong>&lt;/strong&gt; makes things <strong>bold</strong> and &lt;em&gt;<em>em</em>&lt;/em&gt;
            makes things <em>italic</em> both of are used for screen readers to know what to emphasize while reading the screen to disabled users.</p>
        <h3>Fancy Tricks</h3>
        <p>"&lt; and &gt;" are html specific so to type them out you will need to use &gt/lt; gt or lt for greater than or less than. But say you wanna add a 
        new line without making a new paragraph you can't just hit enter because html doesnt care about that, you need to use &lt;br&gt; at the end of the line,
        you don't have to have a closing tag for this either. Want a tab? This one is a little weird &lt;pre&gt;*Tab*   *content*&lt;/pre&gt; will make
        the spacing you see there but you can't forget to hit TAB.</p>
        <h3>Lists</h3>
        <p> There are 2 types of list, ordered and unorder both are made very easily and I will show you in list format, you can probably guess ul is 
            unordered list and ol is ordered list
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Step 1 &lt;ul&gt;</li>
            <li>Step 2 &lt;li&gt;These listing tags should be nested in the ul tags&lt;/li&gt;</li>
            <li>Step 3 &lt;/ul&gt;</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1 &lt;ol&gt;</li>
            <li>Step 2 &lt;li&gt;These listing tags should be nested in the ul tags&lt;/li&gt;</li>
            <li>Step 3 &lt;/ol&gt;</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Notes in html</h3>
        <p>Notes are super useful to leave yourself or other devs comments in your code that wont show up on your webpages to do this is.
            &lt;!-- *notes go here --&gt; Always use notes as it is super useful in case you forgot how or why you did something.</p>

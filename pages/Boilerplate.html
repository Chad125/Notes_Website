    <h3>What is a boilerplate?</h3>
    <!-- Prior to this I was using <p> and </p> on seperate lines with content inbetween but I realized this just adds more lines to the code for no reason
     so to clean it up a little I'm not doing that anymore keeping into old code as an example of improvment -->
    <p>A boilerplate is the basic structure of a webpage, you can also think of it as a template. Every HTML page starts with a doctype declaration which
        just tells the browser what version of HTML it should render. HTML5 is the newest version. Example:<br>
        <!-- &lt; is "<" and &gt; is ">" remember &less than; &greater than; -->
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>
    </p>With our doctype in place it tells the browser what programming language we are using but now what people language, so lets add that in with<br>
    &lt;DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>
    &lt;html lang="en"&gt;<br>
    <br>
    &lt;/html&gt;<br>
    "en" is the code for english, this is primarily used for improving accessibility of the webpage allowing for assitive technologies like screen readers
    to adapt accordingly to the language and use correct pronuncations. You may have noticed that there is a space between the 3rd and 5th lines, this
    is becasue everything we use to build our webpage needs to be inbetween the html tags.</p>
    <p>Now we have our root element and language established we can move onto our head element, our head element is always our first element added under
        out html tag. The head element is where we put our important meta-information about our webpages, also important things required for our webpage
        to render correctly. No content on our webpage should be in our head element. Example:<br>
        &lt;head&gt;
        <!-- <pre>TAB"text"</pre> allows TAB to be shown to make an indentation (must actually use TAB) -->
        <pre>   &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"</pre>
        <pre>   &lt;title&gt;Browser Tab Name&lt;title&gt;</pre>
        &lt;/head&gt;<br>
        meta charset? UTF-8? title? What are all these things?? Well meta charset=UTF-8 is our meta tag with a character set or charset encoding of our
        webpage. We will get to what exactly the encoding is late on. Title is simpily what shows up in the Browser tab.</p>
    <p>We have all of our meta information set up now we just need to actually put content on the webpage with a body element. Example:
        &lt;body&gt;&lt;body&lt;<br>
        We will add to this later on but for now have a look at what a full boilerplate looks like.</p>
    <p>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>
    &lt;html lang="en"&gt;<br>
    <pre>   &lt;head&gt;
                &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
                &lt;title&gt;My First Website&lt;title&gt;
            &lt;/head&gt;
                &lt;body&gt;
            *Content to be added*
            &lt;/body&gt;
    </pre></p>

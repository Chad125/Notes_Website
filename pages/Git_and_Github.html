            <h3>What is Git?</h3>
        <p>
            Git is a version control system, it saves changes made to our code over time in a special data base called the repository, this means we can
            look at who did what and when, this also makes it so multiple people can work on the same project with out passing files back and forth.
        </p>
            <h3>What is GitHub</h3>
        <p>
            GitHub is where you can upload files and store them in a "Git repository" and make changes or "commits" to your files
        </p>
            <h3>Creating a repository</h3>
        <p>
            After making a GitHub account, on the home page create a new repository by clicking on the "+" button in the top right corner and selecting
            "New repository". Name your repository "git-test" and check "Add a README file", then create the repository by clicking "Create repository"
            button at the bottom of the page. This will redirect you to your new repository on GitHub.
        </p>
        <p>
            To get ready to copy(clone) this repository onto your local machine, click the green "Code" which should be to the right of the button
            displaying the current branch. Then select the SSH option in the "Clone" section and copy the line below it. YOU MUST CLICK THE SSH OPTION
            TO GET THE CORRECT URL!
        </p>
        <p>
           CTRL+ALT+T to open terminal so we can create a new directory for all of our projects. Create a directory called repos with the mkdir <command>
            in your home folder. Your home folder is represented by ~ (in linux ubuntu). Now it's time to clone our repository from GitHub into our newly
            created repos directory with git clone followed by the URL you copied in the last step. The full command should look similar to:<br>
            git clone git@github.come:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.GIT<br>
            That's it! You have successfully connected the repository you created on GitHub to your local machine, to test this cd into the new git_test
            folder that was downloaded and then enter "git remote -v" in your terminal, you should see an output similar to the following (USER-NAME is
            your github username)<br>
            orgin git@github.com:USER-NAME/git_test.git(fetch)<br>
            orgin git@github.come:USER-NAME/git_test.git(push)<br>
        </p>
            <h3>Using the Git Workflow</h3>
        <p>
            Create a new file in the git_test folder called "hello_world.txt" with the touch command. Type git status in your terminal, in the output
            your hello_world.txt file should be shown with a red text as well as listed in a section titled "Untracked files" this means that the file
            isn't staged yet. Type "git add hello_world.txt" to add it to the staging area in Git. The staging area is part of the two-step process for making
            a commit in Git. The staging area is like a waiting room for your changes until you commit them. Now type "git status" again. The output file should 
            be in green and in a section titled "Changes to be committed" which means that this file is now in the staging area. Type "git commit -m
            "hello_world.txt" and then type "get status" once more, the output should now say "nothing to commit working tree clean" meaning your changes have
            been committed, don't worry if you get a message that says "upstream is gone", this is normal and only shows when your cloned repository currently
            has no branches. If you get "Your branch is ahead of 'orgin/main' by 1 commit" just means that you no have newer snapshots than what is on your remote
            repository. Both of these will be resolved futher down this page. Last thing type "git log" and look at the output. You should see an entry for your
            "Add hello_world.txt" commit. You will also see other details which include the author who made the commit, the date and time of when the commit was
            made. If your terminal is stuck in a screen with (END) at the bottom just press "Q" to escape.
        </p>
            <h3>Modifing files</h3>
        <p>
            Open README.md in your text editor of choice. In this example we will open the directory in Visual Studio Code by using the command "code ."
            inside your repository. Add "Hello Chad!" to a new line in README.md and save the file with CTRL+S. Go back to your terminal or press CTRL+`
            to open VS code's built in terminal and type "git status" notice how the output is similar to when we created our hello_world.txt file before
            adding it to the staging area, except the README.md file is listed in a section titled "Changes not staged for commit" this is silmilar to the
            "Untacked files" section in that the file is not yet added to the staging area. Add README.md to the staging area with "git add README.md"
            Can you guess what git status will output now? README.md will be displayed in green text in the section titled "Changes to be committed" meaning
            README.md has been added to the staging area. The file hello_world.txt will not show up because it has not been modified since it was committed.
            Open hello_world.txt and add some text to it, save it and stage it, you can use "git add ." to add all files in the current directory and all
            subsequent directories to the staging area. Then type "git status" once more and everything should be in the staging area.
        </p>
            <h3>Finally Committing</h3>
        <p>
            Now all files are in the staging area and add a descriptive commit message. "git commit -m "Edit README.md and hello_world.txt" then 
            type "git status" once again which will output the same "nothing to commit" message as when we previously made a commit. Take one last look at
            your commit history by typing "git log" and you should now see three entries. For the final push to GitHub, type "git push" or to be specific
            "git push origin main" since you are not dealing with another branch (other than main, more on this later) NOTE: IF IT SAYS "SUPPORT FOR PASSWORD
            AUTHENTICATION WAS REMOVED PLEASE USE A PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN INSTEAD" YOU FOLLOWED STEPS WRONG AND CLONED WITH HTTPS AND NOT SSH. Type "git status"
            one last time it should output "Your branch is up to date with 'orgin/main'. nothing to commit, working tree clear". When you refresh your repository
            page on GitHub, you should see the README.md and hello_world.txt files that you just pushed there from your local machine.
        </p>
            <h3>Cheat Sheet</h3>
        <p>
            Commands related to a remote repository:<br>
            git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git<br>
            git push or git push origin main (both accomplish the same goal in this context)<br>
            <br>
            Commands related to the workflow:<br>
            git add .<br>
            git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"<br>
            <br>
            Commands related to checking status or log history:<br>
            git status<br>
            git log<br>
            The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination.<br>
            For example, git add . is read as git | add | . where the preiod represents everything in the current directory<br>
            git commit -m "message" is read as git | commit -m | "message"<br>
            git status is read as git | status | (no destination)<br>
            <br>
            In VS Code you can use "git config --global core.editor "code --wait" to make it so you don't need to -m flag to make a commit message
            instead it will pop up a window specifically for a commit message insuring you can't accidently commit without a message.
         </p>
            <h3>Good Commits</h3>
         <p>
            You should commit every time you make a major change or fix to your code, really anytime you make notable progress. A good commit message will have
            two parts a subject and a body, here is an example<br>
            Add missing link and alt text to company logo<br>
            Screen readers won't read the images to users with disabilities without this infromation<br>
            This gives other developers and spectactors a breif discription of the problem and what you did to fix it.
